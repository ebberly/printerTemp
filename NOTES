NOTES:

@warshaw and @ebberly followed the tutorial from here for wiring:
https://github.com/andrewn/raspi-printer

then installed dependencies, etc. from here:
http://learn.adafruit.com/pi-thermal-printer

then cloned https://github.com/adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer to pi
ran "printertest.py". it worked.
modified printertest.py to say "sitetosite". it worked.

manually forked some code from: https://github.com/adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer 
to https://github.com/site2site/Networked-Printer

files: 
- Adafruit_Thermal.py
- printertest.py

then modified printertest.py to be xoupprintertest.py
prints.
